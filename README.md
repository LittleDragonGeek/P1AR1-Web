# Daysing Games

This project is a school project, but it may also be usable for external users.

We aim to create an interactive web application hosting several web games powered by WebGL. For this purpose, we have utilized Unity, although we are also exploring other engines.

This web app is designed to run on any hardware, ensuring compatibility regardless of the device being used.

Additionally, the hardware counterpart is a significant project that is still in progress. Due to time constraints, progress on this aspect may be slow.

## FAQ

#### When will this project be finished?

There is no definite timeline as this is a school project. However, we anticipate having a more functional version by the end of 2025.

#### Can I try the project?

Certainly! The project is currently deployed at [https://www.marcrtj.de/](https://www.marcrtj.de/), although it is still a work in progress. (Most of the time)

#### What is planned for the future?

We plan to incorporate more self-programmed playable games in the future. However, this may take time as our skill levels are gradually improving.

The next significant step will involve developing the hardware component for the web application, aiming to provide a haptic interface to enhance immersion. This will require figuring out communication between the hardware and software, as well as designing the hardware itself.
